# Stock-Market-Price-Prediction

Project: Stock Market Price Prediction
 
 Description:
Leveraging over 4000 days of historical stock price data, this project aims to enhance market insight and prediction abilities through the development of an advanced LSTM model using the Keras library. By considering the sequential nature of stocks, the model achieves an impressive 86.11% reduction in model loss and attains 99.5% accuracy. With deep understanding of the stock market dynamics and market prediction techniques, this project promises to provide valuable insights into stock price forecasting.
